Topology Recognition simulation for IEEE P802.1Qcz - Congestion Isolation

The Congestion Isolation amendment to IEEE Std 802.1Q-2018 includes a
feature for Topology Recognition.  The feature uses LLDP to exchange
messages and automatically determine a devices level in the topology 
and the port orientation of the port (e.g. uplink, downlink, crosslink).

This code simulates the algorithms used for Topology Recognition in order
to evaluate the correctness of the approach.
